# Marvel-static-website
Hello World; Myself Jatin Sharma and being very much into Frontend development ,i have participated in a clone-a-thon round where they have gave us a website in a pdf form which should be build exactly the same using HTML and CSS within 2 hour of period. 

That PDF is also uploaded in this repositary along with the code.

In that clone-a-thon, there was a advertisement conatiner in middle of the webpage where we have to add a photo that was alloted by them. So everytime wheneever you come on the page ,User will see the same advertisement.

# What additional i have added in this code/website is :
So I have wrote some lines of JavaScript code which will randomly select a photo given in this repositary ,so every time
 when user reload or come to this page he will get differnent ad : )
